Retro Brickle Game with Emoji assets


### Brick Runner Feature Ideas

- A power up that is a 1UP, but if you use it more bricks spawn in, but in places that are unusual, but never overlapping an existing brick.

- Expanded to the Max! Is better than Max power! - similarly figure out appropriate notifications for other needs.

- Improved laser function: have a little triangle blaster thing in the middle of the paddle

- Power up: multi-ball

- Challenge Events - Type specific words into the  text field with your left hand.
-- Gravity! - the ball bounces in a heavy gravity way.

- When the mag-lock releases, the speed of the ball is 1.75 for 2 seconds and its a fireball emoji


- Okay. I have an idea. I can show you a JS file where the sounds are working. You could strip it for context, get my sound links and try to understand what songs go where.
